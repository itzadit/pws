<p>
    During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the British established several coffee plantations in the region, leading to the clearance of large areas of forest cover. The forest cover was also exploited for timber and other forest products.In the 1970s, the government of India recognized the importance of the Western Ghats and established several protected areas in the region to conserve its unique biodiversity. Pushpagiri Wildlife Sanctuary was established in 1987 as part of this effort.The sanctuary is named after the Pushpagiri Peak, which is the highest peak in the sanctuary and is considered sacred by the local communities.
    The sanctuary is home to several endemic and endangered species of flora and fauna, and its conservation value was recognized in 2012 when it was declared a part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Western Ghats.
